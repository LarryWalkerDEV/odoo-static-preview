# 404 Error Fixes - Isolated Summary

## What Was Fixed

All 29 URLs from Google Search Console have been addressed through the `_redirects` file:

### Fix Categories:

1. **WWW → Non-WWW Redirects** (7 URLs)
   - Rule: `https://www.odoo-experten-deutschland.de/* https://odoo-experten-deutschland.de/:splat 301`

2. **Missing .html Extensions** (5 URLs)
   - Individual redirect rules added for each URL
   - Example: `/odoo/odoo-training /odoo/odoo-training.html 301`

3. **Missing Pages → Similar Content** (6 URLs)
   - Redirected to most relevant existing pages
   - Example: `/odoo/odoo-beratung → /odoo/odoo-consulting.html`

4. **Special Redirects** (4 URLs)
   - Custom redirects for specific cases
   - Example: `/odoo-19/ki-integration → /odoo-19/19-odoo-19-ki-features-business.html`

5. **Already Working** (7 URLs)
   - Files exist and work correctly

## Files Changed

Only one file needs to be deployed:

```
_redirects
```

This file contains all redirect rules and is already updated in the repository.

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Commit the redirect changes:**
   ```bash
   git add _redirects
   git commit -m "Fix 404 errors: Add redirects for 29 URLs from Search Console"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **After deployment:**
   - Test a few URLs to ensure redirects work
   - In Google Search Console: "Validate Fix" for the 404 errors
   - Monitor for resolution (usually takes 3-7 days)

## Testing URLs

Test these after deployment:
- `https://www.odoo-experten-deutschland.de/odoo/` → Should redirect to non-www
- `https://odoo-experten-deutschland.de/odoo/odoo-training` → Should redirect to .html version
- `https://odoo-experten-deutschland.de/odoo/odoo-beratung` → Should redirect to consulting page

## Notes

- All redirects use 301 (permanent) status to preserve SEO value
- The `_redirects` file is specific to Netlify hosting
- If using different hosting, convert to `.htaccess` or nginx rules
